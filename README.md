# Unravl

A Firefox extension that suppresses JavaScript translation of websites written in ANY of your preferred languages.

For any polyglot, language learner who
- has multiple preferred languages on Firefox 
- reads different languages on different websites
- values original text over translation
- does not agree with the assumption that everything should be translated to their FIRST preferred language on Firefox

> The name is a reference, if you happen to know _the_ product :)
